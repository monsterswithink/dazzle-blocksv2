Comments

Your users can add comments in context to ask questions, leave feedback, report bugs etc. We handle all complexity to ensure the comments are robust against content changes. We support many types of comment UX patterns as illustrated below.

With `Freestyle` comments, you can pin `Comments` on any elements on the page or draw area comments.[Open in larger window](https://demo-examples.vercel.app/async/comments/area-comments?background=000&theme=dark)

There are several customizable components that work as part of the `Comments` feature set.
